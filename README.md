Shiny FHIR: An Integrated Framework Leveraging Shiny R and HL7 FHIR to Empower Standards-Based Clinical Data Applications.

# Summary
In this study, we describe our efforts in building a clinical statistics and analysis application platform using an emerging clinical data standard, HL7 FHIR, and an open source web application framework, Shiny. We designed two primary workflows that integrate a series of R packages to enable both patient-centered and cohort-based interactive analyses. We leveraged Shiny with R to develop interactive interfaces on FHIR-based data and used ovarian cancer study datasets as a use case to implement a prototype. Specifically, we implemented patient index, patient-centered data report and analysis, and cohort analysis. The evaluation of our study was performed by testing the adaptability of the framework on two public FHIR servers. We identify common research requirements and current outstanding issues, and discuss future enhancement work of the current studies. Overall, our study demonstrated that it is feasible to use Shiny for implementing interactive analysis on FHIR-based standardized clinical data.
